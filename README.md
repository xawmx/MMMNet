# Preprocessing
After setting the path of the data set, you can use dataprocessing for data preprocessing.

# Train
After the first phase of training is completed, the .pth file will be saved, and then the second phase of classifier training needs to be manually performed.

# Test
The test codes for all indicators are in the train.py file. You can select the evaluation indicators for output.
